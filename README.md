# AI Girfriend

This project uses the power of speech-to-text and text-to-speech models to create an interactive AI girlfriend named Nicole. Nicole responds to user queries using AI-generated responses and speaks them back in a human-like voice.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition (ASR)**: Convert user speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **Text Generation (NLP)**: Use Google's Gemini AI to generate responses based on the user's input.
- **Speech Synthesis (TTS)**: Convert AI responses to speech using Kokoro TTS.
- **Interactive Chat**: User can converse with the AI and hear responses in real-time.
